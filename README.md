> Authenticate yourself in Minecraft

### What does it do?

This Minecraft mod helps overcome the infamous session validation error when
connecting to a server:

```
Failed to log in: Invalid session (Try restarting your game and the launcher)
```

...by adding a session validation button to the multiplayer screen. Clicking
this new button will allow you to re-login (hence can be used to changed
Minecraft accounts) to revalidate your session - all without restarting the
game.

_As a side-effect, you can use this to connect to "offline" servers with a
custom username (will have to be set each launch)._
